# Data1030_Final_Project
The project for course DATA1030 in DSI at Brown University.

Dataset Name: World-Stock-Prices-Dataset.csv (based on "World Stock Prices (Daily Updating)" Kaggle dataset) Data Size: 279753 * 12 
Task: Predict future stock price.

In this project, we walk through the whole standard datapipeline from loading data, EDA,... to model deployment. To get the better prediction accuracy, we compare performances of 4 different machine learning models. To know how well machine learning models can achieve, we also compare with baseline models.

Python version: Python 3.12 
Packages Used:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
shap
random
